Hey guys,

I wanted to create a small kinect program related to the project I pitched and will be working on, Math Attack!
I wanted to generate a random math addition question like "1 + 1 = ?" and display it on the screen every 5 seconds.
In order, to achieve this I used XNA programming Sprite Fonts and set some timers and flags.

If you run my program, every 5 seconds you should see a quick flash of a randomly generated math equation. I could not figure out how 
to make the math equation stay on the screen, the Update() method is getting called way too fast and offsets my boolean flags within microseconds. 
I think I need
to implement more complex timers and counters, but I simply ran out of time. I wasted way too much time
trying to set up the development environment on my MAC, and I have ended up resorting to buying a PC :(

My mac was really old, partitioning the hard drive was out of the question and running a VM was as well (very limited
RAM space on my machine). Unfortunately, I found this stuff out the hard way and wasted alot of time I could
have spent exploring the SDK more. I am not making any excuses, I really did try my best to get this assignment done 
but I ran into too many technical problems and I got pressed for time. I will obviously be improving this and expanding
on it in the near future, I was trying to just get the random math equations and display timing functionality done.
